# CORS Popup Policy Fix - Redirect Authentication

## 🚨 **Problem Solved**

**Error**: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call`

This error occurs when modern browsers block popup-based authentication due to security policies. The solution is to switch from popup-based to redirect-based authentication.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Authentication Method Changed**
- **Before**: Popup-based authentication (`loginPopup`)
- **After**: Redirect-based authentication (`loginRedirect`)

### 2. **Files Updated**:
- ✅ `AuthContext.tsx` - Changed to redirect flow
- ✅ `App.tsx` - Added redirect handler
- ✅ `AuthCallback.tsx` - New component for handling redirects
- ✅ `Login.tsx` - Updated UI messaging

## 🔧 **How It Works Now**

### **Redirect Flow**:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Azure AD"
2. **Entire page redirects** to Microsoft login
3. User completes authentication on Microsoft's site
4. Microsoft redirects back to your app
5. App handles the redirect and shows authenticated state

### **Benefits**:
- ✅ **No CORS issues** - No popup blocking
- ✅ **Better security** - Full page redirect is more secure
- ✅ **Mobile friendly** - Works better on mobile devices
- ✅ **No popup blockers** - No browser popup restrictions

## 🚀 **Testing the Fix**

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the authentication flow**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Click "Sign in with Azure AD"
   - You should be redirected to Microsoft login
   - Complete authentication
   - You'll be redirected back to your app

## 📋 **Environment Variables Required**

Make sure your `.env` file has:
```env
VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-client-id
VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id
VITE_AZURE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔧 **Azure AD Configuration**

In your Azure AD app registration:

1. **Authentication** → **Single-page application**
2. **Redirect URIs**:
   - `http://localhost:5173` (development)
   - `https://yourdomain.com` (production)
3. **Implicit grant**:
   - ✅ Access tokens
   - ✅ ID tokens

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### **Before (Popup)**:
- Click login → Popup opens → User authenticates → Popup closes → Back to app
- **Issues**: Popup blockers, CORS errors, mobile problems

### **After (Redirect)**:
- Click login → Entire page redirects → User authenticates → Redirects back to app
- **Benefits**: No blockers, better security, mobile friendly

## 🔍 **Debugging**

If you still see issues:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify redirect URI** matches exactly in Azure AD
3. **Test in incognito mode** to avoid cached issues
4. **Check network tab** for failed requests

## 📱 **Mobile Compatibility**

The redirect flow works much better on mobile devices:
- No popup restrictions
- Better user experience
- Works in all mobile browsers

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

For production, update your redirect URIs:
1. Azure AD app registration
2. Environment variables
3. Update `VITE_AZURE_REDIRECT_URI` to your production domain

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

When working correctly, you should see:
- ✅ No CORS errors in console
- ✅ Smooth redirect to Microsoft login
- ✅ Successful redirect back to your app
- ✅ User profile displayed after login
- ✅ Logout functionality works

**🎉 The CORS popup policy error is now completely resolved!**
